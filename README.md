# Healthcare-Dashboard-in-Power-BI
<b>Project Description</b>

This project focuses on developing a comprehensive, interactive dashboard for Medihope Hospital to monitor patient flow, diagnosis trends, doctor feedback, bed occupancy, and financial metrics. It provides a data-driven approach to hospital management and decision-making by visualizing critical KPIs in a single view.


<b>Objective</b>

•	To track patient admission, discharge, and follow-up cycles.

•	To analyse diagnosis types and frequency.

•	To monitor bed occupancy across different facilities.

•	To evaluate doctor performance through feedback volume.

•	To compare billing amounts with health insurance claims.

<b>Key Features</b>

1.	Patient ID Filter: Focus on individual patient journeys.

2.	KPIs Displayed:

    •	Admit Date
    
    •	Discharge Date
    
    •	Follow-Up Date
    
    •	Total Bill Amount


3.	Bed Occupancy Visualization: Bar chart showcasing occupancy of Private, General, and ICU beds.

4.	Diagnosis Type Breakdown: Horizontal bar chart displaying case counts of six major diagnoses.

5.	Doctor Feedback: Donut chart indicating equal volume of patient feedback across seven doctors.

6.	Financial Overview: Line chart comparing sum of billing vs. health insurance claims for each diagnosis.

<b>Final Results</b>

1.	Total Billing Amount: ₹190.43 Million

2.	Top Diagnoses:

    •	Viral Infection: 2.00K patients
    
    •	Flu: 1.72K
    
    •	Malaria: 1.43K


3.	Bed Usage:

    •	Private Beds: Highest (approx. 4K)
    
    •	General Beds: Moderate
    
    •	ICU Beds: Lowest


4.	Doctor Feedback: Equally distributed (approx. 1.02K per doctor)

5.	Insurance Coverage:

    •	Viral Infection: ₹48M billed, ₹39M insured
    
    •	Flu: ₹46M billed, ₹41M insured
    
    •	Fracture: Insurance claim slightly higher than billing (₹8M vs. ₹7M)

<b>Discussion</b>

I.	The high preference for private beds indicates patient demand for comfort.

II.	Seasonal diseases like viral infections and flu dominate, suggesting the need for preventive measures.

III.	Low ICU occupancy could be a sign of effective early interventions or may require further assessment.

IV.	Balanced feedback among doctors reflects consistent quality of care.

V.	Strong insurance coverage aligns with patient affordability and streamlined claim processing.


<b>Future Improvements</b>

I.	Add patient demographic analysis (age, gender, region).

II.	Implement drill-through functionality for diagnosis-level patient details.

III.	Include real-time data refresh using a connected database.

IV.	Expand doctor performance analysis using sentiment-based feedback.


<b>Conclusion</b>

The Medihope Hospital dashboard is a valuable decision-support tool offering real-time insights into patient care, diagnosis trends, doctor engagement, and financial management. It supports hospital administrators and healthcare professionals in identifying trends, optimizing resource usage, and improving overall service quality.
